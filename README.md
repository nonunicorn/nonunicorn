Hi everyone!
Soon we're going to have latest updates here in a better format.

As of now, we're working hard to release our new UI by mid of Sept.

### Some fresh code pieces:
- [How to find the sum of all the elements of an integer array with c](https://onelinerhub.com/c/sum_of_integer_array)
- [Block specific requests by URL in chrome extensions](https://onelinerhub.com/chrome-extension/block_request)
- [Quickly copy large number of files using scp](https://onelinerhub.com/ssh/copy_large_number_of_files)
